                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>This is my first post on this website. I want to start this journey by telling you all who I am and how my career has been so far.</p>
<p>I am Ranjan, an ECE graduate from BMS College of Engineering in 2017. I am a CyberSecurity analyst and a software developer, who&rsquo;s always in search of new things to learn and experiment.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1:</h3>
<p>I started my professional career in Wipro in 2017. I moved to Kolkata for this and was trained in .Net and SQL training for 2.5 months. I worked as a Project Engineer for almost 2 years after returning to Bangalore. I got a very good exposure to incident response and CyberSecurity L1 roles here. I worked in multiple support and developent roles which helped me acquire debugging, analytical &amp; collaborative skills while working in a geographically distributed team. I quit Wipro for personal reasons in August 2019.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2:</h3>
<p>In what was supposed to be a 3 month sabbatical, I learnt so much in Python. I took up courses, worked on projects and collaborated with <a href="https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/">Puneeth</a> - my mentor and a good friend. I collaborated with him and learnt Web Dev in Django and Flask. With little to no experience in this field before quitting Wipro, I became aware of web dev and other concepts, all thanks to his mentoring.</p>
<p>I started applying to companies in mid-November. It took me 3 months more to get it right and get through the final rounds of any interview. Alas! The world had different plans.. A pandemic!! How unlucky can someone get? I didn&rsquo;t hear from any companies that I cleared the interviews with. The world was struck with a hiring freeze and massive lay offs!</p>
<h3 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3:</h3>
<p>With no job in hand, I started working more on my skills, while applying parallelly. I finally secured a Python Developer opportunity in October 2020 in Racetrack.ai, a start up that specialised in AI chatbots. I handled the entire backend codebase for multiple clients in Real estate and insurance domains. I worked on Python, RASA, NLU, web servers, API frameworks(Falcon), docker, etc.. I got a bit of exposure to Data Science too. All was well, until the company was affected by COVID and fell short of funds. They weren&rsquo;t able to pay the employees and we had to depart. Another unlucky chapter in my life! Ughhh! They say - everything happens for a reason. Is that right?!</p>
<h3 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4:</h3>
<p>The next chapter is a major step in my career. I interviewed with Mindtree in mid-April and secured an offer as a CyberSecurity Analyst. The growth curve has been exponential since then. I started working on Microsoft Security Suite - Azure Sentinel, Defender(EDR) and ATP tools as a L2. I was quick to pick up on the things and got appreciations for my initial work. The debugging and the web dev skills came handy in the investigation/analysis. It just felt natural. I am glad I took that break after Wipro! The confidence boost was immense. I needed that after a streak of bad luck. The awards and recognition from my managers and seniors did wonders too - I managed to get 2 awards within 6 months of joining the project. It feels good to be trusted upon and to be recognised for the work you do, on a daily basis. The learning never stopped - everyday felt like an opportunity to learn something new. I am glad it happened at the right time in my life.</p>
<p>I am in love with the CyberSecurity now and I don&rsquo;t miss a chance to learn something about it everyday. I learn as much as I can, from whatever sources I can learn from. Recently I started listening to podcasts and I have been loving it. It humbles me and makes me feel how little I am in this big world of CyberSecurity.</p>
<p>I want to use my multi-domain skills to make a difference in this world, one day at a time.</p>
