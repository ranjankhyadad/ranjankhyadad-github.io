      <description>Public Exploits   Once we identify the services running on ports identified from our Nmap scan, the first step is to look if any of the applications/services have any public exploits. Public exploits can be found for web applications and other applications running on open ports, like SSH or ftp.  Finding Public Exploits  Google for the application name with exploit to see if we get any results Ex- &amp;ldquo;windows 7 smb exploit&amp;rdquo; A well-known tool for this purpose is searchsploit, which we can use to search for public vulnerabilities/exploits for any application.</description>

      <description>Service Scanning   The first thing we need to do is identify the operating system and any available services that might be running. Check if we can coerce the service into performing some unintended action that supports our objectives, such as executing a command of our choosing. Computers are assigned an IP address, which allows them to be uniquely identified and accessible on a network. The services running on these computers may be assigned a port number to make the service accessible.</description>

      <description>In a nutshell, infosec is the practice of protecting data from unauthorized access, changes, unlawful use, disruption, etc. Infosec professionals also take actions to reduce the overall impact of any such incident.
Data can be electronic or physical and tangible (e.g., design blueprints) or intangible (knowledge). A common phrase that will come up many times in our infosec career is protecting the &amp;ldquo;confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data,&amp;rdquo; or the CIA triad.</description>

      <title>Secure Your Web Apps</title>

      <description>This is my attempt to understand the basic security flaws a web developer might encounter while developing a web application.
This blog is just my takeaways from the Hack the Box&amp;rsquo;s Introduction to Web Applications module. Please refer OWASP Top Ten for the detailed list.
The top 20 most common mistakes web developers make that cause vulnerabilities are:
 Permitting Invalid Data to Enter the Database Focusing on the System as a Whole Establishing Personally Developed Security Methods Treating Security to be Your Last Step Developing Plain Text Password Storage Creating Weak Passwords Storing Unencrypted Data in the Database Depending Excessively on the Client Side Being Too Optimistic Permitting Variables via the URL Path Name Trusting third-party code Hard-coding backdoor accounts Unverified SQL injections Remote file inclusions Insecure data handling Failing to encrypt data properly Not using a secure cryptographic system Ignoring layer 8 Review user actions Web Application Firewall misconfigurations  These lead to our OWASP Top Ten:</description>

      <title>Google Dorking</title>
      <link>https://ranjankhyadad.github.io/blog/google-dorking/</link>

      <description>I came across this article about Google dorking.
With Google&amp;rsquo;s tremendous web-crawling capabilities, it can index almost anything within your website, including sensitive information.This means you could be exposing too much information about your web technologies, usernames, passwords, and general vulnerabilities without even knowing it.
Definition: Google “Dorking” is the practice of using Google to find vulnerable web applications and servers by using native Google search engine capabilities.
Google Hacking Database has a list of all the dorking scripts.</description>

      <description>The process of &amp;ldquo;learning how to learn&amp;rdquo; is complicated. Most of us have never truly learned how to learn effectively.
This useful excerpt is from a module on Hack the Box.
Learning Efficiency The sheer size of the information security field is overwhelming to any new learner. There is a lot to learn and many topics to cover.
The primary and most difficult objective we must overcome is the combination of our knowledge, adaptation, and new information.</description>

      <description>Chapter1 Growth   1% improvement everyday ,makes you 37 times better in a year, while getting worse 1% everyday will take you back to ZERO. Compounding works the same way as money.
  Small changes matter a lot. Results don&amp;rsquo;t come immediately. So, don&amp;rsquo;t slide into bad habits or previous habits. Remember, a small degree shift in the angle makes a larger difference in the direction.
  Focus only on the current trajectory.</description>

      <description>Shortcuts
Auto-Complete
[TAB] - Initiates auto-complete. This will suggest to us different options based on the STDIN we provide. These can be specific suggestions like directories in our current working environment, commands starting with the same number of characters we already typed, or options. Cursor Movement
[CTRL] + A - Move the cursor to the beginning of the current line.
[CTRL] + E - Move the cursor to the end of the current line.</description>
